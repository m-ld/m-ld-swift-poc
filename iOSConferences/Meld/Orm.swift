/**
 A **m-ld** _domain_ is a logical, decentralised set of shared information. The
 content may at any moment differ slightly between clones, but in the absence of
 any writes, and with a live connection, then all clones will 'converge' on an
 identical set of data, as fast as the network can carry the latest changes.

 Object-RDF Mapping (ORM) is the translation of the domain content into
 idiomatic object-oriented Swift constructs (OrmSubjects) in memory, and
 typically on the main application thread, where they can be manipulated.

 An OrmDomain is a Swift Actor because changes to information state are strictly
 serialised from the point of view of the app (even though they may actually be
 concurrent on separate devices; the availability of this simplification is a
 key benefit of using **m-ld**).

/**
 A mutable, observable subject of discourse in the data domain.

 An instance of a class implementing this protocol will correspond to a
 [_subject_](https://spec.m-ld.org/#subjects) in a shared **m-ld** domain.
 Instances must be created using the ``OrmState/get`` method. Once created, they
 can be mutated using normal property setters. Changes made locally can be
 shared transparently and immediately, or can contribute to a 'transaction'
 against a consistent domain state, which delays sharing until the state is
 de-initialised (see ``OrmState``).

 Remote clones participating in the domain may also cause an OrmSubject to
 mutate. Such changes are applied automatically to OrmSubjects, and can be
 notified to user interface constructs via `@Published` properties.

 OrmSubjects are not thread-safe. All mutations MUST be made on one thread,
 typically the main app thread. This can be assured by marking the class as
 `@MainThread`. In a multi-threaded app, separate instances of an OrmSubject
 can be used on each different thread; they will stay in-sync as if they are in
 separate processes or nodes.

 An OrmSubject is serialised to and from the domain via its `Codable`
 implementation. Since remote mutations can happen at any time, the atypical
 ``decode`` method is required in addition to the `Codable` protocol.

     scope (and so de-initialising) may only indicate that it is no longer of
     interest to the local app or user, not necessarily that it should be
     deleted.

     In particular, removing an OrmSubject reference from some other
     OrmSubject's graph, for example in a property, or in a collection property,
     DOES NOT automatically cause it to be deleted. (There is no garbage
     collection based on references in a **m-ld** domain.)

     Similarly, setting this flag DOES NOT cause this subject to be
     automatically removed from some other subject's visible graph.

     > ðŸš§ Since this approach may sometimes breach the principle of least
     surprise, in future we hope to have a way to mark subject 'owners', so that
     deletes are cascaded through reference properties in an intuitive way.

 A snapshot state of the domain. While a state is active, no remote changes
 are applied to the OrmSubjects in the domain. Local changes can be made, but
 they are not transmitted to other clones until the state is committed OR de-
 initialises. Use of a state is required in order to obtain an OrmSubject.
 Once the state is unreferenced, remote changes will be applied to all subjects
 once more.

 Having an active state is not _required_ to make changes to subjects after
 their initial creation. However one may be appropriate to group together
 multiple local changes made in succession (akin to a transaction against an SQL
 database).
